## About

Inspired by the early noughties, this is a somewhat faithful recreation of AIM on windows xp. It includes notification sounds for users enter/leaving and room, and as well as new message notification.

## Installing

Clone the repo into your desired folder then:

```
cd aol-chat-app
cd server
yarn install
yarn dev:server

cd ../client
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## How to use

Open two sperate windows/instances of the app, in one of them create an account name and give it a room id. And in the other just create a username and enter in the room id you created previously. Chat away!
